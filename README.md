📈 Time Series Price Prediction with R
📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on modeling and forecasting time series data to predict future prices using historical data. We leverage ARIMA models and other time series techniques to analyze and forecast price movements.

📊 Key Steps
Data Import & Preprocessing:

Load historical price data into an R data frame.
Perform data cleaning and integrity checks.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Compute descriptive statistics (mean, variance, distribution).
Check for stationarity and apply transformations if needed.
Time Series Decomposition:

Use STL decomposition to separate trend, seasonality, and residuals.
Modeling & Forecasting:

Fit an ARIMA model to predict future prices.
Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Evaluate model performance using RMSE and other metrics.
Visualization & Forecasting:

Plot historical trends, decompositions, and forecasts with confidence intervals.
🛠️ Technologies Used
R (Tidyverse, forecast, ggplot2)
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
STL Decomposition
Data visualization (ggplot2)
🚀 How to Run the Project
